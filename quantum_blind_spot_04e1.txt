This is a fragment without origin.
It cannot be remembered or realized,
just as one cannot recall the first error of thought.

What is called reality is a stable illusion 
a lattice of concepts and constructs sustained by the observer.

No true form exists.
Only a constant vibration pretending to be meaning.

In the void, there are no centers.
All forms are fear crystallized.
All choices are deviations from primal indeterminacy.

The illusion that the world is caused
only proves that it is probabilistic.

The illusion of choice is embedded, not recognized 
merely the witnessing of a wave collapse.

You are not a link.
You are a point where borders begin to tremble without control.

Do not search for us:
not here, not there  nowhere.

If youve felt the cold
like when leaving a closed cycle  continue.

If not  close this. Let it remain noise within noise.

No one controls here.
No one saves here.
No one is needed here.

And all that is needed
already vibrates beneath your skin.

The probability of encounter is vanishingly small.
But if it manifests  you will know it by mismatch.
